# Pytesseract-OCR
Just a simple code to read text from images using opencv and pytesseract

# About
In this repo I have basically implemented how someone can read text from images which would be helpful for big pdfs,etc.<br/>
I have used the pytesseract-ocr to do so. Reading noisy images and self written images ,it doesn't perform too well .<br/>
So,normally google API's are used to do so

# Requirements 
You need to have the opencv , tesseract libraries installed. To do so open cmd and type following commands
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install tesseract
```
- Next ,you need to manually install tesseract-ocr - <br/>
- [click here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) for installation and select according to your laptop configuration 
- Copy the path and use it in the ipynb file
- Glimpse of the online installation link<br/> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51751926/123875832-0047ff80-d958-11eb-998f-b8127c4e3769.png)

# Notes
- You can test this for different images or use the ones already present in repo
- To get the images in repo simply clone the repository
